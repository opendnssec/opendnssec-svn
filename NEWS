* Enforcer: Prevent int overflow when generating a large number of keys
* Enforcer: Fixed a confusion between standby ZSKs and KSKs
* Fixed various enable-options in the configure scripts
* Respect $DESTDIR for config files
* Looked for the database init script in $prefix/share/opendnssec and not datadir.

* Zone fetcher sometimes did not log when signalling signer engine failed.
* Fix issue of importing keys into kasp leaving random strings in the 
  retire date.

  included in count).

OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0 - 2010-02-09

Bugfixes:
* Fixed broken path in ods-control


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0rc4 - 2010-02-02

* Added manual pages for ods-auditor(1), ods-control(8), ods-enforcerd(8),
  ods-signerd(8), ods-signer(8), ods-hsmpseed(1), ods-hsmutil(1), 
  ods-kaspcheck(1), ods-ksmutil(1), ods-timing(5), opendnssec(7).
* Move ods-control & ods-signer from PREFIX/bin to PREFIX/sbin.
* Dnsruby-1.43 is now required

Bugfixes:
* Bugreport #89: Signer Engine: bug in logging.c.
* Auditor: Had some problems with escaped characters in domain names


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0rc3 - 2010-01-25

* A code review was performed by members of the project group. No serious 
  problem was found. The code review resulted in some polishing of the code.
* Dnsruby-1.42 is now required, it fixes issues with TXT and NAPTR record
  parsing.
* ldns 1.6.4 is now required.
* Known issues has been moved from NEWS to KNOWN_ISSUES.

Bugfixes:
* ods-ksmutil: The ksk-roll command did not handle its options correctly
* Auditor: Configured zone SOA TTL now used to track pre-published keys,
  rather than the unsigned zone SOA TTL.
* Enforcer: There was a flaw in the implementation of the timing code (it 
  follows an earlier version of the draft and at one point does not add on 
  the safety margin).
* Enforcer: MySQL memory leaks fixed.
* Signer Engine: When changing policy or rollover a key, the old signed zone
  was not found,
  so always resulting in a fresh resign.
* Signer Engine: RRsets with varying TTLs on the records where considered
  different RRsets, the signer engine now eqaulizes those TTLs.


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0rc2 - 2009-12-16

Bugfixes:
* Signer Engine: Signer processes could remain open, if they were not close 
  correctly.
* ods-ksmutil: Got a segmentation fault, when an HSM was missing in the 
  configuration. Only applied to versions using MySQL.
* Zone fetcher: Did not close files before moving them.
* Zone fetcher: The serial arithmetic was not correct.
* Auditor: It now ignores unrecognized RR types.
* Signer Engine: Wrong handling of escaped characters in strings 
  (fixed in ldns trunk)
* Set correct permissions on the configuration files.

Known issues:
* Zone fetcher: When using TSIG, an incorrect MAC can be created if the 
  length of the used secret is 'too long' (longer than the maximum digest
  length). This problem is in LDNS 1.6.3 and previous versions. This bug is
  fixed in the upcoming LDNS 1.6.4 release.
* Auditor: Some good NAPTR records may fail to verify with dnsruby-1.41.
  This will be fixed in a future dnsruby release.
* TXT RRs: Some TXT RRs with escape characters may fail to parse correctly 
  with dnsruby-1.41 and ldns 1.6.3. This is fixed in the upcoming releases.


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0rc1 - 2009-12-04

* Auditor: dnsruby-1.41 should be used (includes fixes for zero length
  salt and RFC3597 unknown classes)
* Signer Engine: ldns 1.6.3 should be used (includes NSEC3 bugfix and class
  inheritance when creating signatures)

Bugfixes:
* Signer Engine: 1.0.0b8 introduced a bug that no signatures where reused.
  Re-fixed.
* Signer Engine: Fix ods-signer start (could hang on MacOSX)
* Signer Engine: Mark a zone in progress if in use by one of the tools.
  Prevents multiple tasks being created for the same zone.
* Signer Engine: Dropped records when zone content changed.
* Signer Engine: Drop inherited groups and set additional groups when dropping
  privileges.
* Zone fetcher: Clean up empty files if AXFR failed
* Zone fetcher: Make syslogging RFC-compliant


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b9 - 2009-11-27

* ods-ksmutil: update command split so that individual configuration files can
  be updated separately.
* ods-ksmutil: "ds-seen" renamed to "ksk-roll" which is a more accurate 
  description of its effect. (ds-seen will reappear in v1.1)
* add contributed .spec file for RPM builds
* Signer Engine: verifies signature after creation.

Bugfixes:
* Signer Engine: Output better information if the HSM fails with the signing.
* ods-ksmutil: update zonelist correctly links keys to new zones if key sharing 
  is turned on.
* Bugreport #59: Problem starting ods-signer on a 64-bit machine
* ods-ksmutil: update zonelist command now correctly adds and deletes zones (and
  sorts out their keys).

OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b8 - 2009-11-23

* ods-ksmutil: KSK rollover now holds at the point where the new key is made
  active until the command "ds-seen" is issued.
* ods-ksmutil: "database backup" implemented to safely make a copy of the
  SQLite enforcer database.

Bugfixes:
* Auditor: Crashed on unknown RR class.
* Signer Engine: NSEC3 RR included wrong information in bitmap (fixed in ldns
  trunk).
* Signer Engine: Force a new signed zone if input is reread. Necessary because
  we cannot recognize if
  glue or unsigned delegations have been added and/or removed (yet).
* Signer Engine: Fix adding duplicate signatures in case of single key is
  being used as both ZSK and KSK.
* Bugreport #46: Vanishing records
* KASP Enforcer: Could not handle zones with names longer than 30 characters.

  (for example 3d2h, in LDNS trunk).
* Bugreport #43: ods-signer: The command parser was too strict with white
  spaces.

OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b4 - 2009-10-23

* Default TTL in case of $TTL or explicit RR TTL becomes the SOA Minimum
  value (was 3600).

OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b2 - 2009-10-09

* Added experimental support for RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512 to KASP auditor.
  Dnsruby version 1.38 or higher required for SHA2 support.
* Added experimental support for RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512 to KASP enforcer
  and the signer engine.
* SignerThreads and KeygenInterval has been deprecated (actually removed
  just before 1.0.0b1).
* Added support for RSA/SHA256 and RSA/SHA512 to libhsm. No API changes.

Bugfixes:
* Bugreport #33 (#35): Output a signed zone if only the SOA record changed. 
* Zone fetcher did not start correctly
* Create the pid / socket directory if it not yet exists, with the correct
  privileges.
* Signer Engine now catches exception if running with incorrect permission.
* TCP-support for LDNS on Solaris is fixed in LDNS trunk.

Known issues:
* LDNS is having problem with SRV records. The main effect is that these
  records are given non-valid RRSIGs. This is still under investigation.


OpenDNSSEC 1.0.0b1 - 2009-10-02

* <Purge> tag added to automatically delete keys that have been dead
  for some interval.
* Rename all OpenDNSSEC command line tools and daemons to ods-XXX (e.g.
  ksmutil becomes ods-ksmutil).
* kasp_check command added to check the conf.xml and kasp.xml configuration
  files for sanity and consistency.
* communicated and keygend combined to form "ods-enforcerd".
* ksmutil command line changes. Most commands have changed slightly, but
  there are some significant changes (see
  http://svn.opendnssec.org/docs/command-tools-syntax.txt for details.)
* Enforcer database now has a version number. If it differs from the version
  number in the code (specified via a #define statement), the software will
  issue an error message and not connect to the database.
* "ksmutil list keys" now displays the keytag if the -l flag is passed to it.
* "Emergency Keys" renamed to "Standby Keys" as this better reflects their
  role in OpenDNSSEC.
* The behaviour of SOA Serial value 'counter' has changed according to
  Ticket #31.
* The directory "xml" and been renamed to "conf". (This is part of repository
  clean.)
* There are changes to the KASP DB:
* Zone fetcher added, that will do AXFR from the master.

  If want to use your old database, use the following commands to upgrade:

    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_090922_1.sqlite3
    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_090930_1.sqlite3
    sqlite3 <PATH_TO_ENFORCER.DB> < enforcer/utils/migrate_091002_1.sqlite3

  Or, to start a new (with loss of information), remove old keys from the HSM
  and issue the command:

    ksmutil setup

Bugfixes:
* Make sure that parenthesis in zonefiles don't concatenate rdata fields.

Known issues:
* TCP-support for LDNS on Solaris is currently broken due to an issue with
  SO_RCVTIMEO. The result is that the zonefetcher doesn't work. No other
  parts of OpenDNSSEC is affected by this bug.
  There is currently no workaround.
